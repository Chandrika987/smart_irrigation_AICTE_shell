# Smart_Irrigation_AICTE_SHELL
**#**Smart Irrigation Using Machine Learning is a data-driven system designed to optimize water usage in agriculture. The system predicts when and how much to irrigate based on soil and environmental conditions, reducing water wastage and supporting sustainable farming practices.

This project integrates IoT, data science, and machine learning to provide actionable irrigation recommendations for farmers.
**Key Features**

📊 Real-time Data Handling: Soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and rainfall data.

🧹 Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering of collected data.

🤖 Machine Learning Predictions: Predicts irrigation needs using regression/classification models.

📈 Visualization Dashboard: Displays soil conditions, irrigation needs, and weather insights.

🚰 IoT Integration (Optional): Automates irrigation system control.

**Technologies used**
Programming Language: Python 🐍

Libraries & Tools:

Data Handling: pandas, numpy

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, XGBoost

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, Streamlit/Flask (for dashboard)

Data Source: IoT sensor data / CSV datasets / weather APIs

Database (Optional): SQLite or Firebase for storing data
**Project Workflow**

Data Collection → Gather soil & weather data (sensors/APIs).

Data Preprocessing → Clean and normalize inputs.

Feature Engineering → Extract meaningful variables.

ML Model Training → Train model (Decision Tree/Random Forest/XGBoost).

Prediction & Visualization → Show irrigation recommendation on dashboard.

Automation (Optional) → Control irrigation system with IoT devices.
